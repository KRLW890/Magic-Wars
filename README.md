# Magic Wars
A early alpha, turn-based battle system centered around magic as buffs and debuffs.

# Version 1.1.0 is here!
And with it, many changes:

<strong>Play against AI opponents.</strong> You can now play against the computer at three difficulty settings. Great for new players to become more familiar with the game before challenging other players.

<strong>See information on spells and weapons in-game.</strong> A highly requested feature, you don't need to go to the List of Spells page to see basic information on spells anymore. Additionally, this is the first time players have been able to see details about weapons.

<strong>Changes to weapons.</strong> The Sword has been introduced as a new weapon. Additionally, the Musket and Grisner's Warhammer were nerfed, now needing 120 skill and 200 sturdiness to wield, respectively.

<strong>Minor bug fixes</strong>

We hope you enjoy these changes made to Magic Wars.
